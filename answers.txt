1. Adding additional hidden elements to the neural network improves its ability to understand patterns in data, making it more accurate. However, this means you'll need more data and time to train the network. There's a risk that it'll become too proficient at training data and stop performing well with new data. This is also known as overtraining.

2. Increasing the number of hidden elements in a neural network frequently improves its accuracy, but there is a limit. After a while, adding more components may not assist much or may even make things worse, possibly because it begins memorizing the training data excessively.
